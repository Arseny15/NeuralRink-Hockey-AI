# 🔧 Unity Compilation Errors - Quick Fix

## ❌ **What Happened:**
Unity is in Safe Mode because of **54 compilation errors** - mainly missing TextMeshPro and UI packages.

## ✅ **Easy Fix (2 minutes):**

### **Step 1: Close Unity Completely**
- Close Unity Editor completely
- Close Unity Hub

### **Step 2: Reopen Unity Hub**
- Open Unity Hub
- Click **"Add"** and select your `Neural Rink` project folder
- Click **"Open"**

### **Step 3: Wait for Package Installation**
- Unity will automatically install required packages
- Wait for the progress bar to complete
- The errors should disappear automatically

## 🎯 **If Errors Persist:**

### **Manual Package Installation:**
1. In Unity, go to **Window → Package Manager**
2. Click **"+"** → **"Add package by name"**
3. Install these packages:
   - `com.unity.inputsystem`
   - `com.unity.textmeshpro`

### **Alternative: Use Built-in UI**
- The scripts have been updated to use Unity's built-in UI instead of TextMeshPro
- This should resolve most compilation errors
