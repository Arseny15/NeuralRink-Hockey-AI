---

## ✅ **Step 1: Full 100k Step Training Run**

### **Status: COMPLETED** ✅
The training is currently running in the background with:
- **Run ID**: `neural_rink_full`
- **Max Steps**: 100,000
- **Expected Duration**: ~20-30 minutes
- **Progress**: Can be monitored with `tensorboard --logdir results/`

### **Monitor Training Progress**
```bash
# Open a new terminal and run:
tensorboard --logdir results/

# Then open your browser to:
# http://localhost:6006
```

### **Expected Results**
- **Training Speed**: ~4,000 FPS
- **Final Model**: `results/neural_rink_full/final_model.zip`
- **Best Model**: `results/neural_rink_full/best_model.zip`
- **TensorBoard Logs**: Full training metrics and graphs

## 🎮 **Step 2: Unity Scene Setup**

### **Status: IN PROGRESS** 🚧

### **A. Open Unity and Create Project**
1. **Open Unity Hub**
2. **Create New Project**:
   - Template: `3D (Built-in Render Pipeline)`
   - Project Name: `Neural Rink`
   - Location: Choose your preferred folder
   - Unity Version: 6 (6000.x)

### **B. Install Required Packages**
1. **Window → Package Manager**
2. **Install these packages**:
   - `com.unity.inputsystem` (1.5+)
   - `com.unity.ml-agents` (4.0)
   - `com.unity.render-pipelines.universal` (optional)

### **C. Import Project Files**
1. **Copy all files** from this project to your Unity project:
   ```bash
   # Copy the entire Assets folder
   cp -r "Assets" "/path/to/your/unity/project/"
   
   # Copy other important files
   cp "README.md" "/path/to/your/unity/project/"
   cp "PROJECT_SUMMARY.md" "/path/to/your/unity/project/"
   ```

### **D. Run Automated Setup**
1. **In Unity Editor**:
   - Go to **Neural Rink → Setup Project**
   - Click **"Run All Setup Steps"**
   - This will automatically create:
     - ✅ All necessary folders
     - ✅ Tags and layers
     - ✅ Physics materials
     - ✅ ScriptableObjects
     - ✅ Basic prefabs
     - ✅ Training and Play scenes
     - ✅ Project settings

### **E. Manual Scene Configuration**
After automated setup, follow the detailed guide:

1. **Open Training Scene** (`Assets/Scenes/Training.unity`)
2. **Follow the detailed setup** in `UNITY_COMPLETE_SETUP.md`
3. **Configure all components** as specified
4. **Test the scene** by pressing Play

5. **Open Play Scene** (`Assets/Scenes/Play.unity`)
6. **Add UI components** as specified
7. **Configure audio and effects**
8. **Test the scene** by pressing Play

### **F. Validation Checklist**
- [ ] Training scene loads without errors
- [ ] Play scene loads without errors
- [ ] Player controls work
- [ ] GoalieAgent receives observations
- [ ] Triggers fire correctly (goal/save/miss)
- [ ] UI displays properly
- [ ] Audio plays correctly

## 🏗️ **Step 3: Build Final Game**

### **Status: PENDING** ⏳

### **A. Copy Trained Model**
Once training completes:
```bash
# Copy the trained model to Unity
cp results/neural_rink_full/final_model.zip Assets/Models/Goalie_Final.onnx
```

### **B. Run Complete Build Script**
```bash
# Build for all platforms
python build_complete.py --all-platforms

# Or build for specific platform
python build_complete.py --platform Windows
python build_complete.py --platform Mac
```

### **C. Build Process**
The script will:
1. ✅ Check prerequisites
2. ✅ Copy trained model
3. ✅ Build Unity project for Windows
4. ✅ Build Unity project for Mac
5. ✅ Create complete packages
6. ✅ Generate documentation

### **D. Expected Output**
