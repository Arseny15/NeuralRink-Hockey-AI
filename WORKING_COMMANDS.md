# 🏒 Neural Rink - WORKING COMMANDS

## ✅ **All Commands Are Now Fixed and Working!**

### **🔧 Setup (Run Once)**
```bash
# Set up the complete environment
./setup_environment.sh

# This will:
# - Create virtual environment
# - Install all dependencies
# - Verify installation
```

### **🏒 Training Commands**
```bash
# Start 100k step training (takes ~20-30 minutes)
./start_training.sh

# Monitor training progress
./start_tensorboard.sh
# Then open: http://localhost:6006

# Check training status
./check_status.sh
```

### **🏗️ Building Commands**
```bash
# Build game for all platforms (Windows + Mac)
./build_game.sh

# Or use Python directly:
source neural-rink-env/bin/activate
python build_complete.py --all-platforms
```

### **📊 Status and Monitoring**
```bash
# Check everything
./check_status.sh

# View training results
ls -la results/

# Start TensorBoard (smart - detects if already running)
./start_tensorboard.sh

# Stop TensorBoard
./stop_tensorboard.sh

# Restart TensorBoard
./restart_tensorboard.sh
```

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### **Step 1: Setup (One-time)**
```bash
./setup_environment.sh
```

### **Step 2: Training (Already Done!)**
```bash
# Training is already completed!
# Check results:
./check_status.sh
```

### **Step 3: Unity Setup**
1. Open Unity Hub
2. Create new 3D project
3. Import project files
4. Follow `UNITY_COMPLETE_SETUP.md`

### **Step 4: Build Game**

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If any script doesn't work:**
```bash
# Make sure scripts are executable
chmod +x *.sh

# Run with bash explicitly
bash ./start_training.sh
```

### **If virtual environment issues:**
```bash
# Recreate environment
rm -rf neural-rink-env
./setup_environment.sh
```

### **If training issues:**
```bash
# Check dependencies
source neural-rink-env/bin/activate
python -c "import stable_baselines3; print('OK')"
```
